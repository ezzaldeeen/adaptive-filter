In the realm of image restoration, adaptive filters play a crucial role in enhancing and restoring images that have been degraded due to noise, blur, or other imperfections. These filters dynamically adjust their coefficients based on the local characteristics of the image, allowing them to effectively adapt to various types of noise and distortion. The implementation process involves defining a filter kernel or template that is applied to each pixel or neighborhood in the image. Adaptive filters, such as the Wiener filter or the NL-means filter, leverage statistical information from the surrounding pixels to intelligently reduce noise and recover lost details. This approach enables the restoration of images with varying levels of degradation, making adaptive filters a powerful tool in image processing applications ranging from medical imaging to photography post-processing.
